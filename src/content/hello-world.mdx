## What is this?

This is my first blog post in a while. More to come soon.

## Style

I will use this blog to share my thoughts on software design and architecture, new technologies in the web development space, building with these technologies and other things I find interesting. I will also use it to document my journey in tech; hope you find it useful.

## Tech stack

I primarily use Typescript, NodeJS, and React. I also use other languages and frameworks like NestJS, NextJS, Astro, Python, Go etc.

This site is built with NextJS but it still WIP. I will be adding more features to it as time goes on.
